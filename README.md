# Python Game Development Projects

This repository contains a collection of game development projects created with Python and OpenGL, exploring concepts from basic 2D rendering to interactive 3D environments.

## Projects

-   [**OpenGL Basics**](./OpenGL_Basics/): Introductory projects exploring the fundamentals of OpenGL.
-   [**2D Games**](./2D_Games/): A 2D game built from the ground up using the Midpoint Line Drawing algorithm.
-   [**3D Games**](./3D_Games/): A 3D first-person shooter game developed using PyOpenGL.
